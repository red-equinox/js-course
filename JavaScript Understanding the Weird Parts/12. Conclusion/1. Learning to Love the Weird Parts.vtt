I hope through taking this course,
you've come to see that JavaScript can be

2
00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:09.220
a beautiful and
expressive programming language.

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.370
And yes, some parts,
when you first see them, feel weird.

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.290
But I hope you're learning
to love the weird parts.

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.130
Because they're a part of styles and
approaches to programming

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.420
that you can do in JavaScript that you
can't do in other programming languages.

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.440
So I hope you continue your
JavaScript education and

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.260
enjoy programming in this
interesting language.

9
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.610
And stay tuned to this course.

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.060
On occasion, we'll announce bonus lectures
that you'll be able to come back and see.

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.340
Other information more
information on JavaScript in ES6.

12
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.280
But meanwhile I wish you the absolute
best in your programming efforts,

13
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.270
and I hope this course was helpful to you.

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.845
So I just want to say thank you for taking
JavaScript Understanding the Weird Parts.

15
00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:03.930
