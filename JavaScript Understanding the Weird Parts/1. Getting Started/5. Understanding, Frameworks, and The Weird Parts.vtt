00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.570
A couple of last notes.

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.180
In regard to this idea of Understanding.

3
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.410
Remember that JavaScript,
the programming language is really

4
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.360
abstracting you away from how the computer
works and how the browser works.

5
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.020
If that's what you're using
to implement JavaScript,

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.950
or the server that's
running the JavaScript.

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.560
We need to understand how
the tool is functioning

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.560
in order to be able to properly
write JavaScript code.

9
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.990
Deep, advanced JavaScript code.

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.760
We're going beyond just the basics.

11
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.730
So even though it may seem at moments
through this course that we're covering

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.840
something that oh,
you don't really need to know.

13
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.740
You'll find as we progress,
that fundamental foundational knowledge

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.820
is going to brighten the path for you,
give you plenty of Uh-huh Moments.

15
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.460
So be patient as we go through concepts,

16
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.210
because very quickly, you'll see
just how important they really are.

17
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.570
This course is also going
to talk about Frameworks.

18
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.760
One of the best things about
JavaScript the past several years

19
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.570
also happens to be in some
ways one of the worst.

20
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.180
The open source community has developed
a tremendous amount of very popular,

21
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.614
very powerful,
JavaScript libraries and frameworks.

22
00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:27.670
Things like JQuery and AngularJS.

23
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.750
These things are great and they help
us quickly build some pretty neat and

24
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.720
pretty awesome software applications.

25
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.100
However a lot of people

26
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.310
are being introduced to
JavaScript via these frameworks.

27
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.420
Rather than learn JavaScript first,
you might learn jQuery or learn AngularJS.

28
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.780
And JavaScript kind of comes along for
the ride.

29
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.660
The problem is that jQuery and AngularJS
and all these other frameworks and

30
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.240
libraries, as awesome and wonderful as
they are, are just JavaScript code.

31
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.250
They're a JavaScript file that you include
in your application that provides you

32
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.780
a bunch of code that other people, really
smart, good developers have written.

33
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.940
But a lot of developers,
if they opened up those files,

34
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.580
if they opened up that code, they wouldn't
be able to understand what's in it.

35
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.310
Because we tend not to then understand
the deeper parts of JavaScript and

36
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.720
that's dangerous.

37
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.146
If you wanna build a robust,
good JavaScript application,

38
00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:38.960
you can't just know jQuery or
know Angular.

39
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.310
You have to know and understand the things
that the people that wrote jQuery and

40
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.670
Angular know and understand.

41
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.570
And so that's what this course
is going to endeavor to do.

42
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.830
To give you the kind of education,

43
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.490
the kind of information that
will let you open up jQuery.

44
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.570
Look at it.

45
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.210
Look at the source code and understand it.

46
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.470
In fact, at the end of this course,
that's exactly what we're going to do.

47
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.590
Then, we'll try building our own little
mini framework or library just like

48
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.890
jQuery and Angular, and others have
done using the same techniques for

49
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.830
understanding how to structure Java Script
applications and how they work.

50
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.790
So that's Frameworks.

51
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.470
Now the Weird Parts of JavaScript

52
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.630
have to do with people coming
from other programming languages.

53
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.240
Perhaps you are and

54
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.830
having certain expectations
because of how JavaScript looks.

55
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.390
And not understanding just how
different it is under the hood

56
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.789
from most of the mainstream
programming languages.

57
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.480
And yet it's weird parts are often it's
most powerful and beautiful parts.

58
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.840
So, when we say that we're
understanding the weird parts,

59
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.190
what we're really going to do
is understand the hows and whys.

60
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.710
Also no programming language is perfect.

61
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.130
So occasionally through
this course we'll stop and

62
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.060
point out something that's a hazard.

63
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.870
Something that's a danger, a downside of
the JavaScript programming language or

64
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.728
something that you should avoid.

65
00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:11.550
So that's it.

66
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.860
Understanding, Frameworks and
the Weird Parts.

67
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.200
We're ready to dig in to JavaScript.
