00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.910
Let's take just a moment and
talk about setting up for this course.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.890
You'll need two things.

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.450
One, an Internet browser
with developer tools.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.560
That could be Internet Explorer,
Firefox, Safari or Chrome.

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.570
In our case we'll be using Google Chrome.

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.950
And you'll also need a text editor.

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.430
I'll be using brackets.io,
which is free, and

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.767
also lets you quickly and
easily run web pages and JavaScript code.

9
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.917
Now I know we said this course isn't
about building websites or jQuery,

10
00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:43.990
on that sort of thing, just focusing
on the JavaScript programming language.

11
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.590
We're going to do that though,
by writing JavaScript code and

12
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.100
then running it in the browser.

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.960
And using the browser's
tools to learn more and

14
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.600
dig deeper into what
the language is doing.

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.840
If you'd like to match up for

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.570
this course with the tools we'll be using,
you'll need Google Chrome again.

17
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.956
You can find that, if you don't have
Google Chrome at google.com/chrome.

18
00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:12.600
Go to that address, download and
install Chrome on your computer.

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.640
Once you have it installed
you'll be able to go to the menu

20
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.770
and you'll be able to go to more tools and
then developer tools.

21
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.770
Or you can hit F12 on your keyboard.

22
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.800
We're going to spend a lot of time
inside these developer tools.

23
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.660
They'll probably pop out like this for
you, and then, you can use this button

24
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.870
if you like to undock into a separate
window and give yourself a bit more space.

25
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.070
You can also hold down your Ctrl or
Cmd key and then do plus or

26
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.010
minus to increase or decrease the font.

27
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.060
I'll be using a larger font size, so that
you can see what we're doing in the video.

28
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.170
Now, I'll close this with the x in the
upper right of the developer tools window.

29
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.350
And if you want an excellent text editor,
perfect for

30
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.610
this course, just go to brackets.io.

31
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.040
Brackets is provided by Adobe,
it's free, and

32
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.820
it lets you edit html,
CSS, and JavaScript.

33
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.400
And the really nice part is,
you can immediately run it in the browser,

34
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.260
because it comes with a little server,
that's just part of the package.

35
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.760
Again, this is free.

36
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.090
You can go to brackets.io,
install it on your computer.

37
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.280
Once you do that, you just open it.

38
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.750
And as we're writing code in this course
or you're perusing the downloadable code

39
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.820
that the course makes available
we'll just go to file, open folder.

40
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.680
Find a folder,
say a folder on your desktop or

41
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.140
wherever you choose to download
these files to work on it.

42
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.260
That will be the folder
that contains your code.

43
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.150
Then we'll just open our file and
begin writing our code.

44
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.860
You can adjust the theme
under View > Themes

45
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.440
to change your color scheme, or
increase and decrease your font size.

46
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.070
I'll be using again an increased font
size for the purposes of the video.

47
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.914
And that's it.

48
00:03:20.914 --> 00:03:27.190
Google Chrome and brackets, and
you're ready to go for this course.
