00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:06.606
Let's take a moment to describe something
that we'll do throughout this course,

2
00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:07.600
wherever necessary.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.630
In computer science, in programming,
in all of these fields,

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.870
there's a tendency to use words
that sound a lot bigger and

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
more complicated than the thing
that they're actually describing.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.350
So, every now and again, as we're going
through this course, when we're covering

7
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.490
a concept or a topic, and it's important
that we're using the same vocabulary and

8
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.490
that would be understood,
we'll drop one of these Big Word Alert.

9
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.930
When you see that, that means we're
about to discuss a word that's probably

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.840
a lot less complicated than it sounds.

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.270
When we see that,
we'll break glass for emergencies and

12
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.530
give the definition and then some more
detail, and talk about it in some depth.

13
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.700
So as we're going through this course
because this is an under-the-hood

14
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.170
style course,
a course that delves into the details,

15
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.540
don't be intimidated by vocabulary.

16
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.970
These words, these terms, that we may use,

17
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.870
some you may have heard before, others
you may have not are not a big deal.

18
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.530
We'll stop.

19
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.670
We'll discuss them and
then we'll show how they are used,

20
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.590
how these concepts are used
throughout JavaScript.

21
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.050
So remember, it's just vocabulary.
