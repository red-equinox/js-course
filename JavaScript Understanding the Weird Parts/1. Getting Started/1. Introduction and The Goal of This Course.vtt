1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.500
JavaScript.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.090
It's one of the most popular
programming languages today.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.330
Maybe you're new to it.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.170
Maybe you've been using it for years.

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.930
But you can't deny that
some of the most important,

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.060
some of the most widely used software
in the world is written in it.

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.230
But the question is, how well do you
really know this surprisingly powerful,

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.496
sometimes odd, and
often beautiful programming language?

9
00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:36.140
Welcome to JavaScript.

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.119
Understanding the weird parts.

11
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.820
Hi, I'm Tony Alisea.

12
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.620
I'm a 15 year veteran of web application
development and user experience design and

13
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.290
welcome to this course.

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.590
This course is on JavaScript.

15
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.840
Let's be clear, right from the start,

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.900
this course is not about making
a web page interactive in jQuery.

17
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.480
Were the in and outs of Node.js.

18
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.600
This course is focused on JavaScript,
the programming language.

19
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.720
In this course, you're going to learn
how JavaScript works under the hood.

20
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.740
We'll delve into advanced concepts.

21
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.920
You'll come to understand things that
the people that built jQuery understand.

22
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.400
And that will make you a better web
programmer, a better Node.js programmer,

23
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.920
or however else you'll be using
your JavaScript knowledge.

24
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.320
Perhaps you're coming from being
a newer JavaScript programmer or

25
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.220
perhaps you've been using JavaScript for
years.

26
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.040
Or maybe you've been involved in
some other programming language and

27
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.170
are coming to JavaScript.

28
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.128
Other way, this course will
help you to understand that

29
00:01:49.128 --> 00:01:55.430
JavaScript falsely looks like
other programming languages.

30
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.940
Languages like Java or C++ or C#.

31
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.140
Java Script is nothing
like those languages.

32
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.150
It's a different concept,
a different mindset, a different paradigm.

33
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.650
This course will help
you to understand that.

34
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.860
And while many programmers learning
JavaScript or using JavaScript,

35
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.030
find some of its elements as they dig
into the more advanced features, odd or

36
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.390
difficult to learn, or weird.

37
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.380
You're going to find that
when you truly understand it,

38
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.100
understand how JavaScript works and
why it works the way it does.

39
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.830
You'll discover that JavaScript
is a deceptively powerful and

40
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.620
beautiful programming language and it's
one of the reasons why it's so popular.

41
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.110
Now, that actually leads to my philosophy,

42
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.548
when it comes to learning
code my philosophy is this.

43
00:02:49.548 --> 00:02:54.690
Don't imitate, understand.

44
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.676
The biggest mistake I think
people make in designing

45
00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:03.370
programming courses and in looking for
programming courses and

46
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.810
books and materials is looking for
or providing just code to imitate.

47
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.830
Now don't get me wrong,
examples are very important but

48
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.490
examples parroting writing down
the code that someone else wrote for

49
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.600
you on a screen or on a piece of paper.

50
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.360
Only takes you so far.

51
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.660
As soon as you're in the real world and
you have to debug a difficult problem or

52
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.120
you have to start some
code from scratch that

53
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.630
isn't anything like what
you've seen in your examples.

54
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.520
You're gonna fall down.

55
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.640
You're gonna have problems.

56
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.230
You won't be able to move forward.

57
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.900
However, if you deeply understand
what the tool is doing for

58
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.450
you and
the programming language is just a tool.

59
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.650
Then you'll be able to
debug those hard problems.

60
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.210
Come up with innovative and
interesting solutions.

61
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.970
Be able to look at other
people's really good code and

62
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.000
understand it, borrow from it,
or enhance it.

63
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.140
So in this course,
we'll look at plenty of coding examples.

64
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.640
But we'll focus first
on the understanding.

65
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.020
The deep understanding of
the programming language.

66
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.740
So that then the examples make sense, and

67
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.420
then you can use your knowledge in
the real world, in brand new situations.

68
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.550
That said,
it is expected that you have very,

69
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.800
very basic JavaScript knowledge
as you come into this course.

70
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.170
So you understand what a JavaScript
file is, variables, functions.

71
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.630
Basic understanding of functions,

72
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.090
we're gonna dive much deeper into
functions through this course.

73
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.460
And loops.

74
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.070
Just a very basic knowledge
a beginning programmer might have.

75
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.530
If you have that, you're good to go.

76
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.400
So let's get started.

77
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.410
We'll dive in and
I think you'll come to appreciate

78
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.550
this beautiful programming
language JavaScript all the more.

79
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.910
Let's understand JavaScript.

80
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.640
Let's get started.
