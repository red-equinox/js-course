00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.220
If you're interested in all of the
features up coming in the next version of

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.300
Java Script.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.790
There's a great link I'd
like to share with you.

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.380
It's linked in the next lecture.

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.320
It's a link on GitHub to
an explanation of a bunch of features.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.680
So, take a look in the next lecture,
and you'll see it documented.

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.275
The whole lot of interesting things
that are coming to ECMASCRIPT 2015.

8
00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.660
Or what's also called ECMASCRIPT 6.0.

9
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.610
The next version of Java Script.

10
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.080
Let's go take a look.

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.613
You can find it here on GitHub,
if you also do a Google search for ES6 and

12
00:00:36.613 --> 00:00:38.280
ES6 features, one word.

13
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.850
It's a nice list that
is provided by someone.

14
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.600
With an explanation of the things
that are coming, like class.

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.830
Something we've already talked about.

16
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.520
We'll be talking about these things in
bonus lectures as the year goes on.

17
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.590
But it's good to be aware of them.
