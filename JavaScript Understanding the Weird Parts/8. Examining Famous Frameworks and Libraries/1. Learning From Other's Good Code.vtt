00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.010
There are many aspects to improving
as a programmer, as a developer.

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.390
One of the most powerful is
learning from others' good code.

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.260
And what's really terrific about working
inside of the JavaScript architecture

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.780
and the JavaScript community
is that there's a fantastic

5
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.200
treasure trove of good code out there for
you to learn from.

6
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.280
I like to call it an open
source education.

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.230
There are so many frameworks and libraries

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.820
that many thousands of people
use every day, even millions.

9
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.950
And it's open source software.

10
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.500
Meaning that you can just
open the source code.

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
The code of those frameworks and
libraries and read them.

12
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.760
One of the goals of this course thus, was
to give you an understanding of the more

13
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.820
advanced concepts in JavaScript so
that you can go off and read interesting

14
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.370
source code and learn from it, and not be
confused by what your seeing inside of it.

15
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.090
But this is one of those
things that you should do.

16
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.570
Don't be afraid to open what at first
could feel like intimidating source code.

17
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.740
You can learn from these
famous frameworks and

18
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.469
libraries like AngularJS,
jQuery, and others.

19
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.030
So, where can you find all this goodness?

20
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.228
Well, on the internet of course.

21
00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:38.909
GitHub, GitHub.com is not only
a great place to store your code,

22
00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.110
but it's also a great place to learn.

23
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.120
To read source code.

24
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.181
For example I can go to Explore.

25
00:01:49.607 --> 00:01:51.269
And then See all.

26
00:01:54.462 --> 00:01:57.271
And I can go to
Front-end JavaScript frameworks.

27
00:01:59.788 --> 00:02:05.580
And explore things like angular,
backbone, ember, knockout, react.

28
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.240
Famous libraries that people are using.

29
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.690
And I can go right into them and
read their code,

30
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.560
usually in an src folder, for source.

31
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.004
Or I can to the website for that
library or framework, like jQuery.com.

32
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.570
And when I go to Download jQuery,
it will usually give me a option for

33
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.020
either the compressed production version
or the uncompressed development version.

34
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.560
The uncompressed development version is
the one that has all the comments and

35
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.590
you can read the code cleanly and easily.

36
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.020
So you can download that one and
look at it.

37
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.400
Or often time there's a link
to the source code on GitHub.

38
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.270
jQuery has one and
again there's an src folder.

39
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.950
And I can go in and
read some of their code.

40
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.070
I don't know what you might be
thinking but it sounds about as fun as

41
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.420
reading the encyclopedia,
but it is a good education.

42
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.680
You don't have to do it for hours and

43
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.170
hours, but find an element of the library
or framework that you find interesting.

44
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.560
Find something down in
its core that's useful.

45
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.480
Look at its structure.

46
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.070
And see what you can learn and imitate.

47
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.980
This is a really good way to
learn advanced patterns and

48
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.250
concepts in JavaScript.

49
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.050
So I encourage you to make
a practice of occasionally taking

50
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.580
a quick look at the source code of the
framework or library that you're using.

51
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.360
We're going to practice this
right now by taking a deep dive

52
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.680
into the source code of jQuery.
