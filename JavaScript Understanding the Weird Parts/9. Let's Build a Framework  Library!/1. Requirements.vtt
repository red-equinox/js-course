00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.950
All right, so it's time.

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.271
It's time to use everything
we've done in this course so

3
00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:12.244
far to build our own little
mini framework library.

4
00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.545
Frameworks and
libraries are similar concepts,

5
00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:16.470
although frameworks are a more complex.

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.836
But for the purposes of this course we're
going to talk about them as if they were

7
00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:21.480
the exact same thing.

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.570
Because we're focusing on structure.

9
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.620
Not so much what it does.

10
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.750
So let's build our own
mini-framework/library.

11
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.280
And let's build something that you could
use in a project if you wanted to or

12
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.190
in many projects.

13
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.880
All right, let's do something first, that
we need to do for any software project.

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.590
Let's look at the requirements.

15
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.870
What should the software do?

16
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.250
Well, first of all, what is our little
framework library going to be called?

17
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.680
Let's call it greetr.

18
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.490
All this time in this course we've
been using greet as a example,

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.760
and I like to use those simple examples
because we can focus on the concept and

20
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.340
not get lost in the implementation.

21
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.420
But now let's formalize it.

22
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.670
Let's say we wanted to build a library or
frame work that helps us give greetings.

23
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.720
Maybe for when I'm on a website and
someone logs in I can show them

24
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.740
a greeting after they login in the upper
right corner or right after they log in.

25
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.660
And maybe I'd like to do it in
different languages, depending on

26
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.270
what language they choose, their
preferred language in the application.

27
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.950
Something like that.

28
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.760
Let's do the official requirements.

29
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.130
When I'm given a first name, a last
name and an optional language, it should

30
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.960
generate formal and informal greetings
that I could use throughout my app.

31
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.810
It should support both English and
Spanish languages for starters.

32
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.860
It should be reusable,

33
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.920
meaning that it won't interfere with any
of the other JavaScript code in my app,

34
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.950
and someone else can just grab it and
use it in their apps.

35
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.190
And lastly,
even though it's called greetr,

36
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.946
I'd like to have an easy to type
structure, kind of jQuery like, and

37
00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:13.680
a G$, maybe,
like the dollar sign for jQuery.

38
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.930
Let's do G$.

39
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.720
Oh, and one more thing.

40
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.430
All my developers use jQuery
on a lot of their projects.

41
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.910
So greetr should also support jQuery.

42
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.360
Even though it returns greetings what we'd
like is to be able to give it a jQuery

43
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.680
object that points at some HTML element.

44
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.450
And it'll fill that
element with the greeting.

45
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.870
So I could just pass my greetr,
let's say a div or

46
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.240
a span in my HTML that just contains text.

47
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.400
And it'll fill that with my
appropriate greeting text.

48
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.860
All right, so that's the requirement
of our greetr framework/library.

49
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.550
Let's go build it.
