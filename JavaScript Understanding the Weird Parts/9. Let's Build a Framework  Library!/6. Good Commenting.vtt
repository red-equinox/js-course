00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.440
Whoops, see what I just did there?

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.180
I took a deep breath and was so

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.260
glad I finished my code,
I almost made a really bad mistake.

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:20.290
I didn't stop to comment up my code, and
that's especially important in JavaScript.

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.330
JavaScript is not a verbose language.

6
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.279
It's very terse.

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.350
You can do things in very slick and
various ways, and

8
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.160
as a result, good commenting is especially
important when writing JavaScript.

9
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.730
Because while it's not terrible to read,
it really is helpful if you explain

10
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.680
what your intent is, how you're doing
something, for yourself and for

11
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.630
future coders,
because JavaScript is so terse.

12
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.100
That is, it doesn't have a lot of
explanatory text within itself.

13
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.080
You have a lot of literal syntaxes and
those sorts of things, and

14
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.650
so, commenting is really helpful.

15
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.150
So, I've taken our mini library and
framework, and I've commented it up.

16
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.880
And it's available as source code
in the resources of this lecture.

17
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.490
So, you can go find the zip file for

18
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.580
good commenting and take a look.

19
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.110
And this is what we'll use going forward.

20
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.250
So remember in the real world, you might
have to come back to this a year later,

21
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.760
and you will have to
refigure out what you did.

22
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.540
I even did a check of the code while I
was at it, and I had missed something.

23
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.170
Did you notice?

24
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.790
I didn't call the validate when
you initially create the object.

25
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.300
I did when you set the language
later in the chainable function,

26
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.570
but not when you actually create it.

27
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.370
So I missed something important.

28
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.590
So go back through your code in
JavaScript, do a good check of yourself.

29
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.535
And a good way to do that is to
comment what you're doing so

30
00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:12.825
that you can double check the logic and
the flow of what you've done, and

31
00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:17.925
maybe find something you missed,
as well as help the sanity

32
00:02:17.925 --> 00:02:20.835
of future developers that look at
your code, and yourself as well.
