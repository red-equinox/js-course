1
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.170
All right, so it's time.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.870
We've used the knowledge that we've gained
to build our own little mini-framework.

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.990
Well, it's kinda small so
maybe it's a library.

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.430
Either way, let's go ahead and

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.460
use it on a webpage, since,
in this case, we're supporting jQuery.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.040
And even if we weren't supporting jQuery,

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.270
we could use it maybe in some
other way on the server.

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.870
But, let's go.

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.910
Let's use our framework/library
that we just built.

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.380
So I have my immediately invoked function,
and I have all of my code.

11
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.660
By the way,
if you ever see a library that does this,

12
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.780
puts a semicolon before it,
that's another trick.

13
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.260
Just in case there's some other code,
some other

14
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.390
library that may be injected before
the Greetr.js in a script file,

15
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.330
maybe above it, that doesn't quite
finish out its semicolons properly.

16
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.150
You can also put a semicolon there
to make it more completely useful

17
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.625
in that even if the other code doesn't
finish its semicolons out properly,

18
00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:19.520
a code that's used above here,
your code will still run fine.

19
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.930
I just wanted to make mention of that
because you will see it sometimes used.

20
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.250
All right so, I have it all now.

21
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.000
And so I'm gonna use it.

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.460
What I want to do is on
this little webpage.

23
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.870
I'm gonna pretend that this is a login.

24
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
If you're familiar with jQuery
what we're going to do is

25
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.950
add a click event to this button.

26
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.010
And when the button's clicked,

27
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.850
we'll set the greeting based
on the language that's chosen.

28
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.580
We'll create a new object with
the first name and last name.

29
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.500
And we'll just pretend that this
login let us get the first name and

30
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.634
last name of the person back from
the server or something like that.

31
00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:04.567
And then we'll use our greeter to set

32
00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:09.510
this heading with an ID of greeting.

33
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.298
And it needs to do so
with the language that's chosen.

34
00:02:14.298 --> 00:02:22.960
And remember that the HTML greeting
method already sets up the jQuery object.

35
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.390
You just need to give it the selector.

36
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.280
Would you like to try that yourself,
if you're familiar with jQuery?

37
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.190
See if you can use the greeter,
we already have it set up here.

38
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.270
See if you can use it in order
to call the HTML greeting

39
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.790
with the appropriate selector, and
have the language set appropriately.

40
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.330
I'll let you give that a try.

41
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.980
All right,
if you're not familiar with jQuery or

42
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.650
if you already tried it,
just move along with me.

43
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.680
I need a click event on the login
button which has an ID of login.

44
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.220
So I'll just use jQuery, call the jQuery
function, pass it the login ID.

45
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.980
That pound sign means ID.

46
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.210
And a click event and

47
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.020
pass it a function object that I create
on the fly with the function expression.

48
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.120
Then I'm going to make a brand new object,
let's say login greeter.

49
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.540
Use g$ that's our object,
which is created.

50
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.036
And we'll know it's John Doe
because of the user name and

51
00:03:29.036 --> 00:03:31.170
password that they gave or
something like that.

52
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.040
And I'm going to go ahead and
hide this entire

53
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.390
select and button,
this entire drop-down and button.

54
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.970
You didn't have to do this after this so
it has an ID.

55
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.100
And then I'm gonna take my login greeter,
I'm gonna set its language.

56
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.920
And you could have set the language here,

57
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.240
depending on how you want it, but
I'll just do it to show chainable methods.

58
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.432
I need the value of that select box.

59
00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:13.120
It has an ID of lang and
I need it's value.

60
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.150
So I'm gonna pass its
value which is a string.

61
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.249
There's the value,
pass it to set language.

62
00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:23.390
So now my login greeter object will
have a language of whatever was chosen.

63
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.840
And then I'll chain
the method HTML greeting,

64
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.190
I'll pass it the jQuery selector,
which it'll use to create a jQuery object.

65
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.170
And let's say I want a formal greeting,
so I'll say true.

66
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.004
Oh, and I'd like to log this to
the console while I'm at it with

67
00:04:37.004 --> 00:04:37.975
a chainable method.

68
00:04:37.975 --> 00:04:39.170
Got that?

69
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.320
So, when I click the button,
creates a new object using my function.

70
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.050
I'm just going to hide the UI there,
the interface.

71
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.620
And I'm going to set the language based
on what's chosen in the select box.

72
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.723
Chain a method that
actually updates that h1,

73
00:05:00.723 --> 00:05:05.608
because it has an ID of greeting,
right there.

74
00:05:05.608 --> 00:05:07.780
I want a formal one.

75
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.384
And I also want to log it to the console,
all in one line of code.

76
00:05:12.384 --> 00:05:13.581
Let's try it.

77
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:16.147
Refresh.

78
00:05:16.147 --> 00:05:17.122
Login.

79
00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:24.366
Refresh, Spanish, login.

80
00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:25.922
What about the console?

81
00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:28.330
There it is.

82
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.005
Refresh.

83
00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:30.310
Login.

84
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.489
I'm logged in.

85
00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:34.360
Refresh.

86
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.620
Spanish, login.

87
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.750
And it logged it.

88
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.670
It worked!

89
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:47.540
We have nice, clean, safe reusable,
little mini frame work or

90
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:54.720
library that has some neat features
that mimic the structure of jQuery.

91
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.110
And its approach with these
chain-able methods in a function that

92
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.130
returns a new object without me
needing to use a new keyword.

93
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.420
Pretty neat, right?

94
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.920
What do you think?

95
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.680
We have our own reusable mini framework or
library.

96
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.980
And you could use this in your
apps right now if you wanted.

97
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.510
So here's your homework for the future.

98
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.660
Try adding another language.

99
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.280
See if you can do that.

100
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.760
Add support for another language.

101
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.570
Add some methods.

102
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.900
Add some alternate greetings.

103
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.030
Play with this,
see if it makes sense to you.

104
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.098
The last thing we'll do is
we'll add our comments.

105
00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:44.857
Remember, it's JavaScript, and
in any programming language

106
00:06:44.857 --> 00:06:52.080
it's important to have comments,
but especially with JavaScript.

107
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.610
So I'll just add a little
bit of commenting.

108
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.700
So I'll have a commented up usage and

109
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:05.500
inside the actual app
we have that as well.

110
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.560
Inside the actual framework and
library we have everything we need.

111
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.920
And you can take a look through
this code in the finished folder

112
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.590
of the Let's Use Our Framework zip file.

113
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.160
So, I hope you appreciate
how far you've come.

114
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:29.000
We've built our own mini framework
library by understanding JavaScript,

115
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.380
how it works under the hood.

116
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.980
And also by looking around a bit
at the source code of jQuery.

117
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.470
This is how you improve as a developer,
by understanding how things really work,

118
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.270
and looking at others' good code.

119
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.140
So enjoy it!

120
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.556
Remember that writing in
JavaScript can be an extremely

121
00:07:51.556 --> 00:07:54.133
enjoyable experience as a developer.

122
00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:57.490
Because of the nature of
the programming language.

123
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.140
So don't be afraid of learning
something new and trying it.

124
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.640
Enjoy your JavaScript development.

125
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.320
Enjoy all the parts of JavaScript,
even the weird ones.
