00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.965
It's time for another conceptual
aside when it comes to JavaScript.

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.260
This one is single threaded,
synchronous execution.

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.320
So, we have two rather large
looking terms, so guess what?

4
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.730
Big word alert.

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.950
First of all, single threaded.

6
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.960
It sounds pretty complicated but
it's easy to understand.

7
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.170
That means that one command
is being executed at a time.

8
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.500
So any program is full of many commands.

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.110
Many commands within the code.

10
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.490
Single threaded execution means
you're only doing one at a time.

11
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.380
Now, when we're dealing with browsers,

12
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.050
understand that JavaScript isn't
the only thing happening in the browser.

13
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.990
So, when we say JavaScript is
single threaded, It may not be

14
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.845
under the hood of the browser, but
from our perspective as programmers,

15
00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:08.030
JavaScript behaves in
a single threaded manner.

16
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.540
All right, the next one.

17
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.723
And once again, big word alert.

18
00:01:19.723 --> 00:01:24.110
Synchronous, this is very
similar to single threaded.

19
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.710
Synchronous meaning, in the purposes
of programming, one at a time.

20
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.530
Not two at a time or three at a time.

21
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.130
But one line of code being executed for

22
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.760
synchronous execution at a time and,
for our purposes, in order.

23
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.490
So the code is executed one line at
a time in the order that it appears.

24
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.743
And that's it.
Single threaded synchronous execution,

25
00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:55.020
meaning that in JavaScript,
only one thing is happening at a time.

26
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.640
Now I know what you're probably thinking,
but hey,

27
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.110
I've heard of asynchronous requests
in JavaScript, especially on the web.

28
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.130
AJAX, the A stands for asynchronous.

29
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.780
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.698
Well, we'll see that in just a little bit,
but for now, just trust me.

31
00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:16.240
JavaScript is single threaded,
synchronous execution in its behavior.
