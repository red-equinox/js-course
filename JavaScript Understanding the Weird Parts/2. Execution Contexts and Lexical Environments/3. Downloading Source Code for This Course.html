The code gives you <strong style="">both a place to start, and completed code</strong>. </p><p style="">When you are watching a lecture you can find the code by clicking <strong style="">&#039;View resources&#039; (</strong><strong style="">in the upper right of the screen)</strong>. <em style="">If that lecture has code available</em>, a zip file will be listed that you can then download.</p>  <p style="">  	           After downloading the zip file, you can extract (i.e. unzip) it and you will find two folders. One is called &#039;<em style="">Starter</em>&#039;, which contains code to use as starter code so you can follow along with the lecture. The other folder is called &#039;<em style="">Finished</em>&#039; and contains the completed code from the end of the lecture for you to study and compare to your own code.  </p>
